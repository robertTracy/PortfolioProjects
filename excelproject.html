    <p>I used to work for a food delivery service and I always wondered how much some of my customers made for a living.  
        Sometimes my best tips came from the lower income neighborhoods and poor tips came from affluent neighborhoods.  
        I got the opportunity to look at some data from a food delivery service in South America so I used it to learn some key factors in the food delivery demographics.
        With the help of excel, I imported a 2000 row data set and learned:
        
        $1.24 Million was spent on this Food Delivery Service in 2018
        
        75% of the spend variance can be explained by income levels
        
        Growth was mostly constant throughout the year at 183 per month with November and December being low months and January being the highest
        
        The data was given as a data analyst use case for an interview process.
        </p>
    <p>I was able to create a scatterplot that compares a personâ€™s income with the amount of money they spend in the Food Delivery Service.  Here is the scatterplot:</p>

    <p>As you can see, for the most part, as income increases, so does the total spent.  
       Of course there are some outliers, but I was able to fit a line to that relationship that had a R-Squared value of 75 which basically says that 75% of the total 
       spent can be explained by the income, and that means I can reasonably predict how much someone is going to spend next year based on their income level.</p>

    <p>There are a couple of unique outliers in the scatterplot.  On the far left, one person would appear to spend much more than their income, which leads me to believe 
       there is an error in the data.  Sending that person a request to update their income in the app might correct that issue. 
       On the far right, a person with a large income, largest in fact, spends a very small amount on the service.  
       That person may have had a bad experience and stopped using the service.  More investigation might be warranted.  Every customer is important.
    </p>
    <p>To recap, I learned that on average customers each spent $562 over a year, with income levels greatly affecting how much is spent.  
       I always considered the service a boutique, premium service so having higher income individuals spending more is not surprising.  
       I was able to learn pivot tables, bar charts, and I practiced both VLOOKUPs and XLOOKUPs.</p>
